This project is designed to guide learners through fundamental software development concepts, focusing on the principles of object-oriented design. Each module is crafted to introduce a specific concept, ensuring a structured and comprehensive learning journey.

## Modules Description

### Module 00 - Encapsulation
- **Objective:** Introduce the concept of encapsulation, a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that helps in protecting the data integrity of the software components.

### Module 01 - Relationship
- **Objective:** Explore how variables or attributes can be interconnected using specific types of relationships, enhancing the understanding of data structure and OOP.
- Composition:
  - It describes a class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables.
  - The classes of the objects being contained are owned exclusively by the container class and cannot exist independently.
- Aggregation:
  - Similar to Composition but the classes of the objects being contained can still exist independently of the container class.
- Inheritance:
  - A class that inherits anither class shares all the attributes and methods of the referenced class.
- Association:
  - Objects are aware of each other and can interact but there is no strong ownership or dependency implied.

### Module 02 - UML
- **Objective:** Learn about the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is used to graphically represent software architecture, aiding in the visualization and planning of software designs.

### Module 03 - SMART
- **Objective:** Understand the concept of SMART, an acronym frequently used by software developers to define criteria for setting objectives and targets in software development.

### Module 04 - Design Pattern
- **Objective:** Dive into the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, which are standard solutions to common problems in software design, helping to improve the speed and quality of software development.

### Module 05 - Practical Work
- **Objective:** Apply the concepts learned from the previous modules in practical exercises, reinforcing the knowledge and skills acquired through hands-on experience.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of these modules, learners will be able to:
- Understand and apply the principles of encapsulation and relationships within OOP.
- Use UML for effective software design and documentation.
- Implement SMART criteria in setting realistic and achievable goals.
- Recognize and utilize common design patterns in software development.
- Apply theoretical knowledge in practical real-world software development scenarios.
